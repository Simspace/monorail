# CoreUtils

This directory is mostly intended to provide utilities not provided
by the fp-ts ecosystem OR utilities which wrap things from the
fp-ts ecosystem in order to provide different ergonomics.

Try to use functions and types from fp-ts or its ecosystem
instead of writing your own, whenever possible, to reduce the
chance of duplication & the need for writing extra documentation.
