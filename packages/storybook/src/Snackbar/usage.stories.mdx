## Accessibility

(WAI-ARIA: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#alert)

By default, the snackbar won't auto-hide. However, if you decide to use the autoHideDuration prop, it's recommended to give the user [sufficient time](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits.html) to respond.

When open, **every** `Snackbar` will be dismissed if `Escape` is pressed. Unless you don't handle `onClose` with the `"escapeKeyDown"` reason. If you want to limit this behavior to only dismiss the oldest currently open Snackbar call `event.preventDefault` in `onClose`.

```tsx
export default function MyComponent() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(true)

  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <Snackbar
        open={open}
        onClose={(event, reason) => {
          // `reason === 'escapeKeyDown'` if `Escape` was pressed
          setOpen(false)
          // call `event.preventDefault` to only close one Snackbar at a time.
        }}
      />
      <Snackbar open={open} onClose={() => setOpen(false)} />
    </React.Fragment>
  )
}
```
