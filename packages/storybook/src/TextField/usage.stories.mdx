## Limitations

### Shrink

The input label "shrink" state isn't always correct. The input label is supposed to shrink as soon as the input is displaying something. In some circumstances, we can't determine the "shrink" state (number input, datetime input, Stripe input). You might notice an overlap.

To workaround the issue, you can force the "shrink" state of the label.

```tsx
<TextField InputLabelProps={{ shrink: true }} />
```

or

```tsx
<InputLabel shrink>Count</InputLabel>
```

### Floating label

The floating label is absolutely positioned. It won't impact the layout of the page. Make sure that the input is larger than the label to display correctly.

### type="number"

Inputs of type="number" have potential usability issues:

Allowing certain non-numeric characters ('e', '+', '-', '.') and silently discarding others
The functionality of scrolling to increment/decrement the number can cause accidental and hard-to-notice changes
and more - see [this article](https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2020/02/24/why-the-gov-uk-design-system-team-changed-the-input-type-for-numbers/) by the GOV.UK Design System team for a more detailed explanation.

For number validation, one viable alternative is to use the default input type="text" with the pattern attribute, for example:

```tsx
<TextField inputProps={{ inputMode: 'numeric', pattern: '[0-9]*' }} />
```

## Helper text

The helper text prop affects the height of the text field. If two text fields are placed side by side, one with a helper text and one without, they will have different heights. For example:

<Box
  sx={{
    display: 'flex',
    alignItems: 'center',
    '& > :not(style)': { m: 1 },
  }}
>
  <TextField
    helperText="Please enter your name"
    id="demo-helper-text-misaligned"
    label="Name"
  />
  <TextField id="demo-helper-text-misaligned-no-helper" label="Name" />
</Box>

This can be fixed by passing a space character to the helperText prop:

<Box
  sx={{
    display: 'flex',
    alignItems: 'center',
    '& > :not(style)': { m: 1 },
  }}
>
  <TextField
    helperText="Please enter your name"
    id="demo-helper-text-aligned"
    label="Name"
  />
  <TextField
    helperText=" "
    id="demo-helper-text-aligned-no-helper"
    label="Name"
  />
</Box>

```tsx
<TextField
  helperText="Please enter your name"
  id="demo-helper-text-aligned"
  label="Name"
/>
<TextField
  helperText=" "
  id="demo-helper-text-aligned-no-helper"
  label="Name"
/>
```

## Integration with 3rd party input libraries

[Demo using react-imask and react-number-format](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-text-field/#integration-with-3rd-party-input-libraries)

You can use third-party libraries to format an input. You have to provide a custom implementation of the `<input>` element with the `inputComponent` property.

The provided input component should expose a ref with a value that implements the following interface:

```tsx
interface InputElement {
  focus(): void
  value?: string
}
```

```tsx
const MyInputComponent = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  const { component: Component, ...other } = props

  // implement `InputElement` interface
  React.useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    focus: () => {
      // logic to focus the rendered component from 3rd party belongs here
    },
    // hiding the value e.g. react-stripe-elements
  }))

  // `Component` will be your `SomeThirdPartyComponent` from below
  return <Component {...other} />
})

// usage
;<TextField
  InputProps={{
    inputComponent: MyInputComponent,
    inputProps: {
      component: SomeThirdPartyComponent,
    },
  }}
/>
```

## Accessibility

In order for the text field to be accessible, the input should be linked to the label and the helper text. The underlying DOM nodes should have this structure:

```tsx
<div class="form-control">
  <label for="my-input">Email address</label>
  <input id="my-input" aria-describedby="my-helper-text" />
  <span id="my-helper-text">We'll never share your email.</span>
</div>
```

If you are using the `TextField` component, you just have to provide a unique id unless you're using the TextField only client side. Until the UI is hydrated TextField without an explicit id will not have associated labels.
If you are composing the component:

```tsx
<FormControl>
  <InputLabel htmlFor="my-input">Email address</InputLabel>
  <Input id="my-input" aria-describedby="my-helper-text" />
  <FormHelperText id="my-helper-text">
    We'll never share your email.
  </FormHelperText>
</FormControl>
```

## Unstyled

The component also comes with an unstyled version. It's ideal for doing heavy customizations and minimizing bundle size.
