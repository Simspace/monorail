## Integration with 3rd party input libraries

## Accessibility

In order for the text field to be accessible, the input should be linked to the label and the helper text. The underlying DOM nodes should have this structure:

```tsx
<div class="form-control">
  <label for="my-input">Email address</label>
  <input id="my-input" aria-describedby="my-helper-text" />
  <span id="my-helper-text">We'll never share your email.</span>
</div>
```

If you are using the `TextField` component, you just have to provide a unique id unless you're using the TextField only client side. Until the UI is hydrated TextField without an explicit id will not have associated labels.
If you are composing the component:

```tsx
<FormControl>
  <InputLabel htmlFor="my-input">Email address</InputLabel>
  <Input id="my-input" aria-describedby="my-helper-text" />
  <FormHelperText id="my-helper-text">
    We'll never share your email.
  </FormHelperText>
</FormControl>
```

## Unstyled

The component also comes with an unstyled version. It's ideal for doing heavy customizations and minimizing bundle size.
