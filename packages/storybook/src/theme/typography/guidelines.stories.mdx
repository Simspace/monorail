## Guidelines

Always use typography tokens. Our tokens have a pre-defined combination of the following properties: `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `line-height`, `text-transform`, and `letter-spacing`.

### For developers

<Alert severity="warning">
  There is a known Figma bug for non-editors where the incorrect Style name
  and/or values are displayed. If a font style seems inaccurate (e.g., a bold
  text that has a font-weight of 400), check with your designer.
</Alert>

Developers should expect that all hi-fi designs use Typography Styles. If you notice a design does not use Typography Styles that match an existing design token in the code, let the designer know their design should be updated.

You can find Figma Styles by inspecting a text in Figma. In the Inspect panel, you should see a **Typography/[Variant]** under Typography. If it’s hidden, it means the text isn’t utilizing a typography token.

You can also check the CSS section in the Inspect panel. The CSS comment above the declarations is the name of the design token.

### Font Size

Typography variants apply the correct font size.

```tsx
<Typography variant="h1">
```

Some components have a `fontSize` prop. Be sure to check before applying overrides.

```tsx
<HomeIcon fontSize="large" />
```

If you need to assign a custom pixel value, use `theme.typography.pxToRem()` instead. This should be the last resort.

```tsx
<Logo sx={theme => ({ fontSize: theme.typography.pxToRem(160) })} />
```

### Margins

Use the `gutterBottom` prop instead of applying a margin-bottom override. `gutterBottom` adds a margin-bottom of `0.35em`. All `<p>`s automatically get a 16px margin-bottom. 

```tsx
<Typography gutterButtom>
```

### Truncation

The `Typography` component has a `lineClamp` prop that allows text to be truncated to the specified number of lines with ellipsis. The full text will still be available to be read by screen readers.

```tsx
<Typography lineClamp={3}>
```
