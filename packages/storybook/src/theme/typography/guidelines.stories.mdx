## Guidelines

It is recommended to use our typography tokens at all times. Our tokens have a pre-defined combination of the following properties: `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `line-height`, `text-transform`, and `letter-spacing`.

**For developers**

<Alert severity="warning">
  There is a known Figma bug that sometimes displays the wrong Style name and/or
  values. If a font style seems inaccurate (e.g., a bold text that has a
  font-weight of 400), check with your designer.
</Alert>

If you come across fonts in designs that don’t use Figma’s Typography Styles, consult with your designer/s on what typography token to use.
