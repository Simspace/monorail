## Guidelines

It is recommended to use our typography tokens at all times. Our tokens have a pre-defined combination of the following properties: `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `line-height`, `text-transform`, and `letter-spacing`.

### For developers

<Alert severity="warning">
  There is a known Figma bug that sometimes displays the wrong Style name and/or
  values. If a font style seems inaccurate (e.g. a bold text that has a
  font-weight of 400), this is likely the cause.
</Alert>

If you come across fonts in designs that don’t use Figma’s Typography Styles, consult with your designer/s on what typography token to use.

You can find Figma Styles by inspecting a text in Figma. In the Inspect panel, you should see a **Typography/[Variant]** under Typography. If it’s hidden, it means the text isn’t utilizing a typography token.

You can also check the CSS section in the Inspect panel. There should be a CSS comment above the font style declarations like so:

```css
/* Typography/H1 */
font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans';
font-style: normal;
font-weight: 300;
font-size: 36px;
line-height: 48px;
```

### Sizing

In most cases, you won’t need to override font sizes. Here are some options in the event that you do:

1. Some components have a `fontSize` prop. Be sure to check before applying overrides.

   ```tsx
   <HomeIcon fontSize="large" />
   ```

2. Typography variants’ font sizes can be accessed.

   ```tsx
   <Box sx={theme => ({ fontSize: theme.typography.body1.fontSize })}>
   // Or
   <Typography fontSize="body1.fontSize">
   ```

3. If you need to assign a custom pixel value, use `theme.typography.pxToRem()` instead. This should be the last resort.
