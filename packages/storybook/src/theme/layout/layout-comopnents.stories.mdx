## Stack vs Box

A rule of thumb is to use `Stack` whenever you need a `<div>` with `display=”flex”` and use `Box` instead of a plain `<div>`.

## MUI Grid

Alternatively, you can use the [Grid](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-grid/) component to achieve a Flexbox layout.

- MUI `<Grid />` ≠ CSS Grid. It uses Flexbox internally.
- MUI Grid is more akin to Bootstrap’s 12-column grid system.
  - The `spacing` prop uses `theme.spacing()` helper.
- If you need to use CSS Grid, MUI recommends using `<Box />`. (See [MUI CSS Grid](https://mui.com/system/grid/))
