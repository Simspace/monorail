<Meta title="Feedback/Skeleton/Usage Guide" />

## Usage

The component is designed to be used directly in your components. For instance:

```tsx
{
  item ? (
    <img
      style={{
        width: 210,
        height: 118,
      }}
      alt={item.title}
      src={item.src}
    />
  ) : (
    <Skeleton variant="rectangular" width={210} height={118} />
  )
}
```

## Accessibility

Skeleton screens provide an alternative to the traditional spinner method. Rather than showing an abstract widget, skeleton screens create anticipation of what is to come and reduce cognitive load.

The background color of the skeleton uses the least amount of luminance to be visible in good conditions (good ambient light, good screen, no visual impairments).

### ARIA

None.

### Keyboard

The skeleton is not focusable.
