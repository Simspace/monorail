import { TooltipMonorail } from '@monorail/visualComponents/tooltips/Tooltip'

Tooltips provide a bit more information about an element or feature. This helps new users familiarize themselves with the app.

```tsx live
<div>
  <TooltipMonorail
    label="The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
    aria-label="Info Tooltip"
  >
    <Icon icon="info" />
  </TooltipMonorail>
</div>
```

## Usage

Tooltips are used to inform users of any additional or helpful content. A tooltip is always displayed from an on-hover or on-focus interaction targeted at an element. Tooltips provide contextual help so it is not always necessary to view the information. It is only useful when the user requires further assistance.

- Unlabeled icons
- Product-specific terminology

### Dos

- Tooltips **should** be used to identify elements, provide additional information about a certain element such as a description.
- The content **should** be short and concise.
- The pointer **should** always be pointing to the center of the trigger element.
- The tooltip **should** only be displayed on an on-hover or on-focus interaction (mouse and keyboard).

### Don'ts

- It **should not** display content that is critical for the user to know or content that needs to be referred back to numerous times.
- It **should not** block related content. If itâ€™s too long, it should probably be somewhere else.

## Behavior

**Position**  
By default, the tooltip is centered below trigger element. Its pointer will always be center aligned with the trigger element.

**Collisions**  
When the tooltip is within 8px of the viewport's edges, it will adjust itself accordingly to avoid cropping.

**Timing**  
There is a 100ms delay when triggered and a 500ms delay on leave.

## Specs

The tooltip always has a 16px padding on left/right edges and a 12px padding on top/bottom edges. The pointer is 4px away from the trigger.

The maximum width for a tooltip is 256px. The text will then wrap and the tooltip will expand vertically in order to keep consistent with margins.
