## Usage

Communicates authoring of content. Used in sections where it would be beneficial for the user to know the source of the material, like:

- Event headers
- Content catalog cards
- Content overview

## Principles

**Identifiable**  
Logos and branding elements should be easily identifiable from each other.

**Shape**  
All brand elements will be shown with a white background with rounded borders.

**Size**  
Brand elements size should remain standard.

## Types

### SimSpace Logo

Default logo for SimSpace. Other logos should be created and used in the branding elements in a similar way.

### Default

The SimSpace Logo is a vector svg image that adjust to the available space.

```tsx live
<SimSpaceLogo style={{ height: 32 }} />
```

## Logo Box

Logo Box allows to display logos in a standardized way across the platform.  
It should be used anytime the author logo is displayed as a part of a content preview or detail.

### Default

It creates a container with white background and rounded corners.  
The Logo Box is by default positioned relative.

```tsx live
<LogoBox>
  <SimSpaceLogo />
</LogoBox>
```

### Top left aligned

It can be aligned to the top left including the prop **alignLeft**

```tsx live
<LogoBox alignLeft>
  <SimSpaceLogo />
</LogoBox>
```

### Top right aligned

Similarly, it can be aligned to the top right including the prop **alignRight**

```tsx live
<LogoBox alignRight>
  <SimSpaceLogo />
</LogoBox>
```
