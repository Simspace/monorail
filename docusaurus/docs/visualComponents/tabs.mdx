Tabs organize content across different screens, data sets, and other interactions.

<ShowCase>
  <TabBar>
    <Tab>First Tab</Tab>
    <Tab>Second Tab</Tab>
    <Tab>Third Tab</Tab>
  </TabBar>
</ShowCase>

## Usage

Tabs organize and allow navigation between groups of content that are at the same level of hierarchy.

## Principles

**Informative**  
Tabs should be named appropriately to indicate the content they contain.

**Order**  
Tab order should be consistent across an experience. Tabs with related content should be grouped adjacent to each other.

**Reactive**  
Tab behavior during standard, focus, hover, and active states are important because it lets users know where they are in the experience.

## Types

### Tab

A Tab Bar is constructed with multiple Tab components. Tab has a background color upon hover.

```tsx live
<Tab>Tab</Tab>
```

### Tab Bar

The Tab Bar indicates the active tab with a blue line underneath its text.

```tsx live
<TabBar>
  <Tab>First Tab</Tab>
  <Tab>Second Tab</Tab>
  <Tab>Third Tab</Tab>
</TabBar>
```
