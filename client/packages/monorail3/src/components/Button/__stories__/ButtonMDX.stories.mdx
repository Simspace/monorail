# Button

This is an MDX page for Button. The code is not type-checked because typescript doesn't work with .mdx files.

This is probably not something we'd use for development, but might be useful for UX for documentation. These files are fragile because there is no type-checking, and it's essentially just javascript code and hand-written text.

export const Template = (args) => <Button {...args}>Button</Button>

## Variants

### Contained

This is a contained button.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Contained" args={{ variant: 'contained' }}>{Template.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>

### Outlined

This is outlined

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Outlined" args={{ variant: 'outlined' }}>{Template.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>

### Text

This is a chromeless text button

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Text" args={{ variant: 'text' }}>{Template.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>

### Vanilla

This is just a Button with no Story/Template wrapper. This doesn't show up as a proper story in the sidebar.

<Canvas>
  <Button variant='contained' color='secondary'>My Vanilla Button</Button>
</Canvas>

### Imported story

This doesn't seem to work, not sure why

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Imported Default">
    <Default />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Default />
</Canvas>

### Linked story

<Story id="buttons-button--default" />

## Args table

<ArgsTable of={Button} />
